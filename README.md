# Geospatial notebooks

This repository contains experimental notebooks for geospatial algorithms related to urban planning.

## Development

To create a development environment, first make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, follow the steps below.

1. create a virtual environment `python -m venv .venv`
2. activate the virtual environment 
    - on Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    - on Windows: `\env\Scripts\activate.bat`
3. install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run Jupyter Lab `jupyter lab`

Once Jupyter Lab is running, you can access any of the desired notebooks.
